# ICLC 2025 - Proposal for Live Performances

Live Performances (including audio, visual, and A/V or multimedia)
will largely be sorted into one of two formats: a concert format, with
seated audience; and an Algorave format, unseated and intended for
dancing. As we explore venues and dates, and according to patterns
that we see emerge from the submissions received, we intend to program
several different subcategories of the concert format.

## 2. Abstract

2. Abstract
Live electronic music and live coding and performative visuals 
from the Art of the Fugue by J.S. Bach. Work that explores the possibilities 
of representation of this work unfinished, which Bach was unable to 
complete before his death.

Applying the same compositional concepts of recursion and uncertainty, 
this is a visual session where technology is reveals chaotic but transparent, 
making video, cameras coexist direct, object treatment through the overhead 
projector and visible code digital programming through Hydra. 
 
A conception about the rebirth of an open piece, about returning to the 
generative from the work of artists who worked algorithmic centuries before 
the emergence of artificial intelligence.

It is important for us to work with the temporalities and materiality 
of systems and languages. Crossing the plasticity and performativity of 
transparency from the use of the overhead projector as well as the recursion 
of Bach with the digital base and the live interpretation of 
the visuals, a material livecoding.

## 4. Program Note

Live electronic music and live encoding and performative visuals of 
the Art of Fugue by J.S. Bach. A work that explores the possibilities 
of representation of this unfinished work, which Bach was unable 
to complete before his death.

The performance focuses on the performativity of touching plastic 
elements that are recorded and at the same time are aesthetic, 
sensory elements, materiality that is digitized live and revived 
on the screen under the code through the music.
